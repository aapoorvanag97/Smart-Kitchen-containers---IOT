# Smart-Kitchen-containers---IOT


READ Smart Kitchen Containers - SYNOPSIS first for better understanding.


Ever wondered how technology can help us transform our ordinary kitchen containers
into smart ones? Our research paper is mainly based on the above stated question. One of the most apt use cases in a kitchen is the constant storage and replenishment of
groceries. Now imagine, if the most common accessory in any kitchen, i.e., a
container could keep track of what, when and where you buy your commodity and
also keep a check on the amount you spend while doing so. In addition, the
commodity that you require is delivered to your doorstep as and when it gets empty
without your intervention. This is what our paper aims to deliver. Each container has an ultrasonic sensor near its lid and it keeps track of the distance
between the lid and the grocery level. This height is passed on to the Raspberry pi
module which is programmed to check the distance frequently and to automatically
order that particular grocery online if the height is greater than threshold as it
indicates that the grocery is running out of stock. An e-mail notification is also sent
to the user before ordering an item online. User interface is developed to check the
quantity of all groceries from anywhere and at anytime. This application of IOT is a
part of Home Automation.
